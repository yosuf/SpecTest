Assignment description:
The lecture notes of this week discuss the conversion of Boolean formulas (formulas of propositional logic) into CNF form. The lecture
notes also give a defnition of a Haskell datatype for formulas of propositional logic, using lists for conjunctions and disjunctions. Your task
is to write a Haskell program for converting formulas into CNF, and to
test whether the conversion is correct.

Deliverables: 
- conversion program, 
- implementation of a number of tests,
- test report, 
- indication of time spent.
